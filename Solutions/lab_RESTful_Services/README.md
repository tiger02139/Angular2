For this lab, you'll need two projects - the RESTful server and the Angular Client (ngCliDemo)

Make sure you've either done the "npm install" in BOTH directories or copied over the appropriate node_modules folder from StudentWork/install

StudentWork/install/rest/node_modules --> restServer/node_modules
StudentWork/install/node_modules --> ngCliDemo/node_modules
